# Git Fetch vs Git Pull

1. git fetch:
- Downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.
- Does NOT automatically merge them into your working files.
Example:
git fetch origin

2. git pull:
- Does everything fetch does, PLUS automatically merges the changes into your current branch.
Example:
git pull origin main

# Summary:
- git fetch = safe, preview changes before merging.
- git pull = direct merge with remote changes.
